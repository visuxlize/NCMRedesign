## üìñ Project Overview

This project represents a complete redesign of the New Castle Metal website, focusing on modern user experience principles, streamlined navigation, and maximizing information accessibility without overwhelming users with multiple page transitions. The redesign transforms a traditional multi-page corporate website into a more engaging, informative single-page experience that better serves both commercial and residential customers.

## üéØ Design Philosophy
